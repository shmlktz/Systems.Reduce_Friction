# Systems.Reduce_Friction

With all the beautiful & effective tools we have available to us, it's fitting for us to get back those extra minutes each day on mundane tasks that could eliminated, automated, or accounted for in other ways. It's high time we organize ourselves smarter and let the tools do the work for us, instead of us serving the tools. Let us take care of our tasks more intelligently. This project is en route & will bring more effective methodologies and tools to help with life's regular needs, for the regular guy & the CEO alike. Cheers to a bright & efficient future!
